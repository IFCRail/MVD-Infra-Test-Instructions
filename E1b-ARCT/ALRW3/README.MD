# ALRW3 - Cosine (Horizontal Layout + Cant Layout)

# Summary (Intent)

The testcases provided in this folder shall check the proper implementation of IfcAlignment transition bend with cant in a very compact but nevertheless comprehensive manner. The testparameters given describe synthetic cases for the tested transition bend types.

The testcases were developed in the alignment workpackage of the IFC Rail project and were later on refined with the cant parameter. Input data are the parameters as the are typically used in track engineering.

The supplied parameterlists and pointlists were calculated according to the principle of diverse development using two  independent implementations.

Implementation 1 is based on a set of preexisting python modules using a very generic double integration approach to calculate x,y coordinates from the base parameters length, curvature and cant.

Implementation 2 is based on the first implementation of an IFC tool vendor consisting of the following steps:
Translation of the segment parameters from the so called business representation in the product layer into IFC entities belonging to the IFC geometry core. (a.k.a. enrichment).
Evaluation of geometry core entities to obtain the 3D geometry.
Export of the obtained points into 2D x,y pointlists and an applied cant value which represents the contribution of cant to the track axis (a.k.a. alignment).

The lists of x,y and cant contribution to track axis z + the resulting inclination angle are given as a result list.
Testdata is provided for transition  bends stated below.

* Clothoid
* Helmert
* Bloss
* Cosine
* Sine
* Viennese Bend

# Test Case Imports

For each of the 64 supplied testcases the required set of baseparameters are given.

# Usages, Constraints & Logic

Each test consist of one alignment segment only. Change in curvature and change in applied cant extend along the complete length of the segment.

For each transition bend types the following combinations are given:

* straight line connected with leftleaning circular arc segment
* straight line connected with rightleaning circular arc segment
* leftleaning circular arc segment connected to straight line
* rightleaning circular arc segment connected to straight line
* leftleaning circular arc segment connected to a second leftleaning circular arc segment with smaller radius
* rightleaning circular arc segment connected to a second rightleaning circular arc segment with smaller radius
* leftleaning circular arc segment connected to a second leftleaning circular arc segment with greater radius
* rightleaning circular arc segment connected to a second rightleaning circular arc segment with greater radius

## Expected Results

For each case, it requires:

* an IFC 4.3 file, and optionally

* Tables of points (one row for each station) along the tested alignment segment containing the values listed below:
  * Station on segment
  * Seg-specific X-coordinate
  * Seg-specific Y-coordinate
  * Curvature at station
  * Applied Cant at station
  * Cant Angle at station



## Validation criteria

The calculated values shall be identical up to the ??? digit after the decimal point.
