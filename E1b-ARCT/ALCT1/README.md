## Summary (Intent)

This test instruction is defined for IFC4.3AbRV_E1b_ALCT1 Alignment Railway Cant 1.

This test instruction covers following subjects:
- Project setup including units, context and global position
- Minimum set of spatial structure 
- One alignment for railway including horizontal, vertical and cant layouts
- Alignment segments including linear segments, circular arc segments and clothoid transition segments
- Alignment design covers the scenario that vertical alignment is measured from track center line so left and right cant are reciprocal at each point along alignment
- Alignment design covers the scenario of scissor cant
- Properties for alignment segments

The [Expected Results](#Expected-Results) section lists the material that will be used to assess the fulfilment of capabilities.

## Expected Results

For certification of capabilities the only source will be:

- n. 1 IFC file containing the information as requested. The file shall be named using the following syntax: `MVDCode`-`ExchangeCode`-`TestCode`-`SoftwareVendor`.`ifc` (Example: `IFC4.3_AbRV-E2b-ASTPC-AmazingSoft.ifc`)

- Screen-shot of the alignment in 3D
- Screen-shot of the alignment layouts in 2D
- CSV export of point list of the IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve and IfcGradientCurve
