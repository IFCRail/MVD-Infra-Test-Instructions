## Variations
The Following occurrence variations need to be checked and certified in relation to the targeted entities and concept templates:

- Entity_01 - *description of variation*
- Entity_02 - *description of variation*


## Usages
The following itemised restrictions and constraints shall be placed on IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

- IfcSomething
    - *Constraint*


The Test case requires the following additional checks related to Model Geometry:

- *Constraint*


## Model Dataset
This test case utilises the attached dataset documented by the following drawings and data schedule. 

*This is a later step that involved the detailed documentation of the certification dataset (model)*


## Drawings (Visualisations)
The following Drawings and visualisations describe the test case dataset to be modelled and certified.
