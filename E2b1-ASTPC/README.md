|  Aggregate structures + Track. Pavement and Course (ballast) + Cant | E2b1 | ASTPC | Evandro Alfieri | RFI |

## Summary (intent)

This test case uses some elements of the railway track domain to test the following capabilities:
- Object grouping
- Object classification via external reference (i.e., bSDD)
- Object typing
- Object decomposition (assemblies)
- Project Global Positioning
- Railway spatial structure
- Railway alignment (with cant)
- Linear placement along alignment
- Properties of objects


The business context for the test is provided by a 2km portion of railway line, including: 2 alignments, track substructure and superstructure, and related products.  

### Test instructions (**high-level**, <ins>**not necessarily in this order**</ins>)

1. Model project breakdown structure (spatial structure)
1. Model alignment(s)
1. Geo-reference model
1. Model track objects type and objects (ballast, rails, sleepers, etc.)
1. Group objects, assemble objects
1. Classify objects
1. Model properties of objects/object types
1. Assign objects to project breakdown

## Variations
The Following occurrence variations need to be checked and certified in relation to the targeted entities and concept templates:

- Entity_01 - *description of variation*
- Entity_02 - *description of variation*


## Usages
The following itemised restrictions and constraints shall be placed on IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

:construction: under construction :construction:

- IfcSomething
    - *Constraint*

The Test case requires the following additional checks related to Model Geometry:
