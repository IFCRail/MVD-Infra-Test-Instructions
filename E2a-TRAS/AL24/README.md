## Summary (Intent)

This test case addresses the **export** and the **import** of the required IFC entities for the exchange of **stationing information for railway alignment without cant**. It builds on the test **AL22**, adding two `IfcReferent` entities, respectively to *Alignment 1_Primary route* and *Alignment 2_Diverted route*. These entities will be used:
- by the **export test** to verify the correct use of the nesting structure for `IfcReferent` into the `IfcAlignment`
- by the **import test**, along with some validation parameters, to verify the correct import of the provided alignemnt dataset.

Additional information:

- Refer to [Test Case Imports](#Test-Case-Imports) to know the prerequisites for the present test.

- The [Expected Results](#Expected-Results) section lists the material that will be used to assess the fulfilment of capabilities.

- :zap: This is a test-driven process: refer to the [Validation Criteria](#Validation-Criteria) to understand what is required by the test :zap:




## Itemised Roots

The Test instruction addresses the import and export of the following IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

<details><summary>IFC Entities</summary>

These entities represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_E2a exchange and the overall AbRV MVD. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the MVD**

- Model setup:
   1. IfcSite
   1. IfcRailway
- Alignment:
   1. IfcAlignment
   1. IfcAlignmentHorizontal
   1. IfcAlignmentVertical
   1. IfcAlignmentSegment
   1. IfcReferent
</details>

<details><summary>Concept Templates</summary> 

These concept templates represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_Ex exchange and the overall AbRV MVD, that must be correctly exported to meet the validation criteria. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the MVD**

- Project Context

## Model Dataset

This test case utilises **no particular dataset**. All information required to fulfil the test are captured in these Test Instructions.




## Test Case Imports

All validation criteria (and usages) of predecessors' tests shall be **verified for this test too** (regression test principle). Prerequisites for the present test case are listed below.

#### Notes on Pset usage for Linear Referencing Method and Stationing

There are two Pset applicable to IfcReferent that can be used for this test.
- `Pset_Stationing`: Specifies stationing parameters for IfcReferent;
- `Pset_LinearReferencingMethod`: Describes the manner in which measurements are made along (and optionally offset from) a linear element;
  - For `Pset_LinearReferencingMethod`, you might want to check that the property **LRMType** is set correctly. Example: in this test, being the referents placed at the origin point of each alignment to mark its initial stationing (i.e., 0+000), the the property value shall be set to **LRM_ABSOLUTE**
